# Customizing the Environment
(appendix)

Itâ€™s useful to have some aliases. Throughout the book, full commands were
written explicitly, but the following are shorter versions that can speed up
your game.

    alias sc=systemctl
    alias ssc='sudo systemctl'
    alias ce='crontab -e'
    alias vi-cron='vim -o /etc/crontab /etc/cron.d/*'
